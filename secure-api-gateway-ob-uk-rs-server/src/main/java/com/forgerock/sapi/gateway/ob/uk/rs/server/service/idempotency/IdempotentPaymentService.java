 * Service which can find an existing payment for a particular idempotencyKey.

 * Otherwise, the calling code may continue to validate the request and create the payment.
 *
 * This provides a simplified payment submission idempotency implementation, that is good enough for a test facility.
 * The TPP is able to test the idempotent behaviour of the API serially, including error conditions such as idempotency
 * key being reused but the request body being changed.
 *
 * There is no idempotency guarantee when idempotent requests are submitted concurrently.
 *
 * A proper implementation should occur in a layer or component before the biz logic, and needs to handle concurrent
 * access.
