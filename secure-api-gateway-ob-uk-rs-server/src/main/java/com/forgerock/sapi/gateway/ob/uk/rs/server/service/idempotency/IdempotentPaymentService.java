 * Service which can find any existing payment for a particular idempotencyKey.

 * This provides a simplified payment submission idempotency implementation. It is not guaranteed to work when there
 * are concurrent requests with the same idempotencyKey. This service is aimed at allowing TPPs to test idempotent
 * behaviour in a sequential fashion.
 *
 * A proper impl of idempotency should be handled in a gateway or as a request filter, a separate datastore is required
 * which tracks requests and responses.
